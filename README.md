### Installation Guide
1. Enable WSL and install Ubuntu from Microsoft Store (Windows only)
2. If you install Homebrew with WSL it will be in a custom directory with all the apps you install with brew.
You will have to make brew and all the apps globally available with this command:

`eval (/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)`.

Put this in your `config.fish` (if you use mine its already included)
3. Install fish shell. Example: `brew install fish`.
4. Make it your default shell with `chsh -s $(which fish)` in bash. (You might have to add it to the `shells` directory first)
5. Install Nerd Fonts directly from website on your system and set it in your terminal application.
6. Install Fisher as plugin manager. `curl -sL https://git.io/fisher | source && fisher install jorgebucaran/fisher`
7. Install Tide theme with Fisher. `fisher install ilancosman/tide@v5`
8. After configuring tide, copy parameters from `conf.d/tide.fish` to the end of `conf.d/_tide_init.fish` file.
9. Install z for fish. `fisher install jethrokuan/z`
10. Install exa. `apt install exa` or `brew install exa`

If its not availabe, download it manually:
```md
wget -c http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/r/rust-exa/exa_0.9.0-4_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install ./exa_0.9.0-4_amd64.deb
```
1. Install ghq  `brew install ghq`
2.  Install fzf `brew install fzf`
3.  Install ghq for fish `fisher install decors/fish-ghq`
4.  Install fzf for fish `fisher install jethrokuan/fzf`

Used for directory jumping.

Remembers which diretories you visited and you can instantly jump to them without having to type the whole path
